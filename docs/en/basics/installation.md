# Installation

## npm

It is recommended to use npm to install, it can be better used with the webpack packaging tool.

```bash
npm i lv.js
```

## CDN

At present, you can get the latest version of the resource through [unpkg.com/lv.js](https://unpkg.com/browse/lv.js@last/), introduce the js file on the page and start using.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/lv.js/lib/index.js"></script>
```

If applied to a development environment, use a compressed version.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/lv.js/lib/index.min.js"></script>
```
