# Name

## Why is it called Lvp?

1. lvp is simple and easy to remember.

2. The author likes LOUIS VUITTON (Lv for short).

3. l is the first letter of the first word of the author's name, and v is the first letter of validation.

4. At first this library was called lv, but this name has already been posted on npm. So I had to add a p, which means lv plus.
